# Object Recognition Model on CIFAR-10 

## Overview 
This project focuses on building an object recognition model using advanced deep learning algorithms, specifically ResNet50 and DenseNet, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, including airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. 

## Project Structure - 
**`data/`:** This directory contains the CIFAR-10 dataset or instructions on how to obtain it.  
**`models/`:** Here, you can find the trained ResNet50 and DenseNet models after training. 
**`src/`:** The source code for the object recognition model is organized in this directory. It includes scripts or notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
